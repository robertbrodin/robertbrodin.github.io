## Le Jardin El Mokri

Phebe Cunningham, Sarah Johnson, Cate Pitelli, Rob Brodin

Tourat Mdinty is a NGO located at the El Mokri Palace in Fes, Morocco, whose mission is to create interactive programs and experiences which educate the local community in the Fes Medina. In the Medina, environmental education and public access to green space is limited. Tourat Mdinty has given us access to several gardens on the El Mokri property. To improve environmental education and interactive learning in the Fes Medina, we propose a garden design plan to modify existing gardens on the El Mokri property, a garden maintenance manual to maintain the planned modifications, and a guide for possible interactive programs between the gardens and the community.
